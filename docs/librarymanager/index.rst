Library Manager
===============

..

    *"The missing library manager for development platforms"* [#]_

*PlatformIO Library Manager* allows you to organize external embedded libraries.
You can search for new libraries via :ref:`Command Line interface <cmd_lib_search>`
or `Web 2.0 Library Search <http://platformio.org/#!/lib>`_.

You don't need to bother for finding the latest version of library. Due to
:ref:`cmd_lib_update` command you will have up-to-date external libraries.
