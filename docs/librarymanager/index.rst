Library Manager
===============

..

    *"The missing library manager for embedded platforms"* [#]_



*PlatformIO Library Manager* allows you to organize external embedded libraries.
You can search for new libraries via :ref:`Command Line <cmd_lib_search>`
or `WebSite <http://platformio.ikravets.com>`_ interfaces.

You don't need to bother for finding the latest version of library. Due to
:ref:`cmd_lib_update` command you will have up-to-date external libraries.

    <http://bower.io>`_ package managers for web.
