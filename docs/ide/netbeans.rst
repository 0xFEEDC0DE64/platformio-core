NetBeans
========

NetBeans is a Java-based integrated development environment (IDE). It provides
out-of-the-box code analyzers and editors for working with the latest Java 8
technologies--Java SE 8, Java SE Embedded 8, and Java ME Embedded 8. The IDE
also has a range of new tools for HTML5/JavaScript, in particular for Node.js,
KnockoutJS, and AngularJS; enhancements that further improve its support for
Maven and Java EE with PrimeFaces; and improvements to PHP and C/C++ support.

Refer to the `C/C++ Application Learning Trail <https://netbeans.org/kb/trails/cnd.html>`_
for details.
