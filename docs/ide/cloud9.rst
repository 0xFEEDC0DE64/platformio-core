Cloud9
======

`Cloud9 <https://c9.io/>`_ combines a powerful online code editor with a full
Ubuntu workspace in the cloud.
Workspaces are powered by Docker Ubuntu containers that give you full freedom
over your environment, including sudo rights. Do a git push, compile SASS, see
server output, and Run apps easily with the built-in Terminal and Runners.
