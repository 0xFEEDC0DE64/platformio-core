`Atom <https://atom.io>`_ is a text editor that's modern, approachable,
yet hackable to the coreâ€”a tool you can customize to do anything but also use
productively without ever touching a config file.

PlatformIO IDE for `Atom <https://atom.io>`_ is the missing integrated
development environment which provides comprehensive facilities
for IoT development:

* Cross-platform builder without external dependencies to the system
  software:

    - 200+ embedded boards
    - 15+ development platforms
    - 10+ frameworks

* C/C++ `Intelligent code completion <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion>`_
* C/C++ `Code Linter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>`_
* Library Manager
* Built-in Terminal

* ``cmd-alt-u`` / ``ctrl-alt-u`` builds and uploads (if no errors).
* ``cmd-alt-c`` / ``ctrl-alt-c`` cleans compiled objects.
* ``cmd-alt-t`` / ``ctrl-alt-t`` / ``f7`` run other targets (Upload using Programmer, Upload SPIFFS image, Update platforms and libraries).
* ``cmd-alt-g`` / ``ctrl-alt-g`` / ``f4`` cycles through causes of build error.
* ``cmd-alt-h`` / ``ctrl-alt-h`` / ``shift-f4`` goes to the first build error.
* ``cmd-alt-v`` / ``ctrl-alt-v`` / ``f8`` toggles the build panel.
* ``escape`` terminates build / closes the build window.

More details `Atom Build package <https://atom.io/packages/build>`_.

Code completion and Linting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PlatformIO IDE uses `clang <http://clang.llvm.org>`_ for the code completion
and linting. To check that ``clang`` is available in your system, please open
Terminal and run ``clang --version``. If ``clang`` is not installed, then install it:

- **Mac OS X**: Install the latest Xcode along with the latest Command Line Tools
  (they are installed automatically when you run ``clang`` in Terminal for the
  first time, or manually by running ``xcode-select --install``
- **Windows**: Download the latest `Clang for Windows <http://llvm.org/releases/download.html>`_.
  Please select "Add to PATH" option on the installation step.
- **Linux**: Using package managers: ``apt-get install clang`` or ``yum install clang``.
- **Other Systems**: Download the latest `Clang for the other systems <http://llvm.org/releases/download.html>`_.

**Warning**: If you have previously generated PlatformIO project you need to
reinitialize it using ``Menu: PlatformIO > Initialize new Project (or update existing)``
and specify for the which board should be activated Code completion and Linter.
