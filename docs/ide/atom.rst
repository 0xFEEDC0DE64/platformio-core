PlatformIO IDE for Atom
=======================

PlatformIO IDE for `Atom <https://atom.io>`_ is the missing integrated
development environment which provides comprehensive facilities
for IoT development:

* Cross-platform builder without external dependencies to the system
  software:

    - 200+ embedded boards
    - 15+ development platforms
    - 10+ frameworks

* C/C++ Intelligent code completion
* C/C++ Smart code linter
* Library Manager for the hundreds popular libraries
* Built-in Terminal which allows to run PlatformIO CLI (``pio``, ``platformio``)

Atom is a source code editor that's modern, approachable,
yet hackable to the coreâ€”a tool you can customize to do anything but also use
productively without ever touching a config file.

.. warning::

    PlatformIO IDE is **in beta testing**. Please report all issues to
    `PlatformIO IDE issues tracker <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-atom-ide/issues>`_.

Requirements
------------

The only one requirement is `Python Interpreter <https://www.python.org>`_.
PlatformIO is written in Python and works on Mac OS X, Linux, Windows OS and
ARM-based credit-card sized computers (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, CubieBoard).

Installation
------------

:Python:

    Python is installed on Mac OS X and Linux OS by default. The only **Windows Users**
    should install it manually. Please `Download the latest Python 2.7.x <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
    and install it. **DON'T FORGET** to select ``Add python.exe to Path`` feature on the
    "Customize" stage, otherwise ``python`` command will not be available.

:Atom: Download and install `Atom <https://atom.io>`_ source code editor

:PlatformIO IDE:

    Install `platformio-ide <https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide>`_ package
    using:

        - **Mac OS X**: ``Menu: Atom > Preferences > Install``
        - **Windows**: ``Menu: File > Settings > Install``
        - **Linux**: ``Menu: Edit > Preferences > Install``

Building / Uploading / etc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``cmd-alt-b`` / ``ctrl-alt-b`` / ``f9`` builds project without auto-uploading.
* ``cmd-alt-u`` / ``ctrl-alt-u`` builds and uploads (if no errors).
* ``cmd-alt-c`` / ``ctrl-alt-c`` cleans compiled objects.
* ``cmd-alt-t`` / ``ctrl-alt-t`` / ``f7`` run other targets (Upload using Programmer, Upload SPIFFS image, Update platforms and libraries).
* ``cmd-alt-g`` / ``ctrl-alt-g`` / ``f4`` cycles through causes of build error.
* ``cmd-alt-h`` / ``ctrl-alt-h`` / ``shift-f4`` goes to the first build error.
* ``cmd-alt-v`` / ``ctrl-alt-v`` / ``f8`` toggles the build panel.
* ``escape`` terminates build / closes the build window.

More details `Atom Build package <https://atom.io/packages/build>`_.

Code completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PlatformIO IDE uses `clang <http://clang.llvm.org>`_ for the code completion.
To check that ``clang`` is available in your system, please open
Terminal and run ``clang --version``. If ``clang`` is not installed, then install it:

- **Mac OS X**: Install the latest Xcode along with the latest Command Line Tools
  (they are installed automatically when you run ``clang`` in Terminal for the
  first time, or manually by running ``xcode-select --install``
- **Windows**: Download the latest `Clang for Windows <http://llvm.org/releases/download.html>`_.
  Please select "Add LLVM to the system PATH" option on the installation step.
- **Linux**: Using package managers: ``apt-get install clang`` or ``yum install clang``.
- **Other Systems**: Download the latest `Clang for the other systems <http://llvm.org/releases/download.html>`_.

.. warning::
    The libraries which are added, installed or used in the project
    after initializing process will not be reflected in code completion. To fix
    it you need to reinitialize project using ``Menu: PlatformIO > Initialize new Project (or update existing)``.

Code linter
~~~~~~~~~~~

PlatformIO IDE uses PlatformIO's pre-built GCC toolchains for code linting. You
can customize it in ``.gcc-flags.json`` which will be generated for the selected
board in the project directory using
``Menu: PlatformIO > Initialize new Project (or update existing)``.

.. warning::
    The libraries which are added, installed or used in the project
    after initializing process will not be reflected in code linter. To fix
    it you need to reinitialize project using ``Menu: PlatformIO > Initialize new Project (or update existing)``.

Install Shell Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install ``platformio`` and ``pio`` shell commands please use ``Menu:
PlatformIO > Install Shell Commands``. It will allow you to call PlatformIO from
other process, terminals and etc.

Serial Monitor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Serial Monitor was temporary disabled in PlatformIO IDE 0.2.1. See
`issue #17 <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-atom-ide/issues/17>`_.

Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Built-in Terminal doesn't support ``STDIN`` interaction
